# Portfolio API
![Portfolio Icon]("./public/icon-256x256.png")

I'm currently using [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/), and a free-tier [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com/) cluster for my backend. This will soon be hosted on [Heroku](heroku.com) so I can fetch my data and I wouldn't have to worry about both backend & frontend.

I was initially working with Gatsby but wasn't sure if I could dynamically fetch data from my MongoDB, so I switched over to a new setup (Express.js & Next.js).

View the <b>[schema table](./docs/schema.md)</b> generated by [graphql-markdown](https://github.com/exogen/graphql-markdown).

## TODO

* Add caching so it doesn't need to refetch from MongoDB all the time. (I won't be updating portfolio every other hour, so daily/weekly saves _could_ be beneficial).
